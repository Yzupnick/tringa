# Tringa
Tringa is a library for building system administration and software deployment tools. 

## Goals
Tringa aims to provides some useful abstractions for managing infrastructure and deploying software, 
while still allowing teams to build tools that fit their own workflows.

### Yes Goals


## Reasons
Many of these reasons are opinions not facts. I will add some supporting arguments over time,
but for now, either they resonate with you or they don't.

### A lot of code is often easier to read and modify than a lot of configuration.
### Most programming languages have better means of combination and abstraction than serialization languages.
### It is sometimes clearer to write imperative code.
### Most languages have great facilities for distributing and re-using packages.

## Why F#?
I like the language and the platform allows teams to create single file binaries that are easy for teams to package and distribute.

## Does the world need a another tool for managing servers or deploying software?
I don't know, We will find out I guess!

## Contributing
I will be building this library out in the open. 

Feel free to contribute or make suggestions. 

Please be respectful and patient, I am only one person.
